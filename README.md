## 💼 Experience

- **Backend Engineer Intern @ Eulerity**  
  Focused on backend services integrating with social media APIs, integrating Meta webhooks for real-time tracking, and configuring scalable log archival strategies on Google Cloud that reduced costs significantly.  

- **Research Assistant @ Rutgers University**  
  Built a computer vision pipeline with YOLOv8 to analyze chemical test strips for coral reef research, reducing analysis time by 90% and improving accuracy in predicting chemical concentrations.  

- **Software Engineer @ Wells Fargo (Capital Markets Division)**  
  Worked on full stack development for payment systems processing FED/SWIFT wire transactions worth $1B+ in daily transfers. 

- **Software Engineer Intern @ OYO (Oravel Stays Pvt Ltd)**  
  Enhanced monitoring of services by building Prometheus-based API health reporting and deployed serverless infrastructure on AWS Lambda for scheduled monitoring.  

- **Software Engineer Intern @ Nucleus Software**  
  Designed a financial chatbot using Rasa with speech and OCR features, improving accessibility and reducing manual data entry time.

## 📌 Projects

- **Intelligent Job Search Assistant**  
  Built using **LangGraph** and **DeepAgents**, this assistant automates job discovery and email communication. One sub agent integrates with LinkedIn MCP for fetching job insights, while another manages Gmail communications, streamlining the application process with an agentic AI.  

- **TestStripDX: Object Detection of URS-10 Strips**  
  Created an very affordable alternative to expensive lab equipment by training YOLOv8 models to detect URS-10 test strip components and predict chemical concentrations using OpenCV-based color analysis, cutting costs while increasing efficiency. 

- **Twitter Search**  
  Designed a high-performance Twitter search engine using **FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis**. Built data pipelines for 100k+ users and 135k tweets, optimized queries with advanced indexing, and achieved sub-millisecond response times with caching.  

- **Web Crawler**  
  Developed a modular web crawler with a strong emphasis on **object-oriented design and clean coding practices**. The system was built with extensibility in mind, making it simple to integrate new scraping and parsing features without disrupting the existing framework.  

- **Notification System**  
  Architected a scalable and reliable microservices-based notification system inspired. Implemented **Kafka pub-sub architecture** with FastAPI services for notification scheduling, user preferences, and delivery. Containerized with Docker and tested with load simulation, it demonstrated high throughput and low-latency under stress.  

- **Sentence-Level AI-Generated Text Detection**  
  Explored the detection of AI-generated vs. human-written sentences using transformer-based models. Designed experiments around sentence embeddings, classification thresholds, and benchmark datasets to improve detection reliability.  

- **Brave Bot (AI Decision-Making Bot)**  
  Developed a grid-based rescue bot using **policy iteration, value iteration, and deep neural networks** in a MDP based grid. The bot learned optimal strategies to herd a crew member to safety, reducing evacuation time from 236 steps to ~25 steps, demonstrating reinforcement learning in action.  

- **ChatFusion: Real-Time Chat Application**  
  Built a full-stack messaging system with **Java, Spring Boot, React, WebSocket, and AWS**. Achieved <50ms latency using webhooks for real-time messaging, integrated LangChain + OpenAI as a chatbot assistant, and deployed with AWS EC2, RDS (MySQL), and S3 hosting.  

- **AI-NewsHub**  
  Developed a news aggregation platform using **Python, Django, BeautifulSoup, and Streamlit**. Aggregates and displays 100+ daily AI-related articles from YouTube, newsletters, blogs, and conference feeds, serving as a one-stop AI insight hub.
